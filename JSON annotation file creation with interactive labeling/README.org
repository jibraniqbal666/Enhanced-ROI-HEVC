I am producing text file first with storing those values that are distinct for all images.
After this, I am parsing text file and then producing JSON file accordingly.

This method helped in preserving progress.
For example, if at 1300th image, my program gets terminated, I can simply restart by changing image_id variable from 0 to 1299.
